# 🧩 User Scripts Collection

A small collection of **userscripts** for browser enhancements, convenience utilities, and site-specific tweaks.

All scripts are located in the `/scripts` directory.  
Each `.user.js` file is standalone and includes its own metadata and description.

## ❓ Why userscripts?

Userscripts are small JavaScript files that run in your browser to modify how websites behave.

They can:

- Fix annoyances or missing features
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Add quality-of-life improvements
- Work across browsers with a userscript manager

Think of them as lightweight, install-only-what-you-need browser extensions.
