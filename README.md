A collection of userscripts for browser enhancements, convenience utilities, and site-specific tweaks.<br />
All scripts are located in the `/scripts` folder, each with its own purpose and description.

## 🚀 How to Use These Userscripts

Userscripts need a browser extension to load/run them.

### 1. Install a Userscript Manager

I recommend [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

### 2. Install Scripts

Open any `.user.js` file in this repo and your manager will prompt you to install it.

Example repo structure:

```
/scripts/
 ├── ytdl.user.js
 ├── ytaudioFix.user.js
 ├── ytUploadTemplate.user.js
 └── more...
```

### 3. Update & Manage

Userscript managers automatically check for updates based on metadata tags.
Scripts can be enabled/disabled individually through the extension dashboard.
